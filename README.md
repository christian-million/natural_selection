# Disclaimer

I am trying to replicate the simulation model presented in the following youtube video using python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&vl=en

The thoughts and ideas presented in that video are not my own and all credit should go to the owner of that channel / video / content. I am using the thoughts and ideas in that video educationally - as a prompt to improve my skills in python.

# Overview

Ultimately, my goal is to create a GUI from which the user can set parameters on a headless (custom) version of [this
natural selection simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&vl=en). A summary of the simulation results will be sent to a Discord server using their
API.

If time allows, Iâ€™d love to be able to set parameters and execute the model with Discord commands, but I
am nervous that building the headless simulator will take up most of my time.

# Parameter Descriptions

Currently the GUI allows the user to control the many parameters of the models. Here are the descriptions of each, organized similarly to how the GUI presents them:

## Settings

- `N_AGENTS`: The initial population size of the model

- `N_FOOD`: The amount of food available on each new `day`

- `N_DAYS`: How many `days` the model will run

- `DAILY_STEPS`: How many `steps` are available in each `day`

## Environment

- `PREDATOR_RATIO`: The percent difference in `size` between `Agents` that dictates who is prey / predator. (e.g., `Agent` A is 20% larger than `Agent` B. `Agent` A is a predator to `Agent` B)

- `FOOD_SIZE`: How big is the food. This impacts an Agents ability to `sense` the food.

- `FOOD_VALUE`: How nutritious is the food.

- `EAT_DIST`: How close an `Agent` has to be in order to eat the food / other `Agent`.

- `HEIGHT`: The Y value of the environment grid

- `WIDTH`: The X value of the environment grid

- `HEADING_MOD`: When `wandering` how many degrees (+-) can an `Agents` `heading` change

- `STEP_BUFFER`: How many steps Agents will allow themselves to begin heading home. If it will take X steps to get home, the agent will start heading home at X + STEP_BUFFER steps remaining.

## Mutation

- `MUTATION_RATE`: How likely is a mutation during reproduction

- `REPRODUCTION_MOD`: What percentage of energy (relative to it's own) must a Agent eat in order to reproduce.  

- `SPEED`: Speed of initial cohort of Agents (Distance traveled in 1 step)

- `SIZE`: Size of initial cohort of Agents (Radius of body)

- `SENSE`: Sense of initial cohort of Agents (Radius of detection)

- `SPEED_MOD`: What percentage can speed increase/decrease on mutation

- `SIZE_MOD`: What percentage can size increase/decrease on mutation

- `SENSE_MOD`: What percentage can sense increase/decrease on mutation

- `SPEED_ALLOW`: Allow speed mutations?

- `SIZE_ALLOW`: Allow size mutations?

- `SENSE_ALLOW`: Allow sense mutations?

# Known Improvement Opportunities

- Build out `defaults.json` with descriptions, categories, and widget type to ease programmatically building UI.

- Incorporate descriptions in GUI

- Incorporate `overlap` into method of `Pos`

- Add subplots that show `speed`, `size`, `sense` development summaries

- Have Agents and Food generate ID's in `__init__` using model (Not as passed param)
